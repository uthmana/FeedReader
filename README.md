# Project Overview

In an existing project given to me by Udacity for my nanodegree course, using Jasmine to test if the Javascript is working properly.

* Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
* Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty 
* Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
